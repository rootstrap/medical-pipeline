November 25, 2123



Interim History:	

Comes to review diabetes and related problems.

He feels that he gets tired and needs to rest more after doing any exercise. He denies shortness of breath or chest pain, but he is not just describing generalized fatigue in that this is clearly related to physical exercise. He has not had an ETT since April, 2122.

Home Blood Tests:  

B 	103-149

L	not testing

S	not testing

HS	150-175, about 2pc



Retinopathy:	Sees Dr. Dailey each January. In January, he had very mild diabetic retinopathy and slight macular degeneration.

Nephropathy:	Due for microalbumin/creatinine ratio; normal in past.

Neuropathy:	No foot discomfort.

Cardiac:	above; has seen Dr. Brian recently.

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Has had flu shot this year.

He told me in 2119 that he had had a PneumoVax, but did not know exactly when.



Social History: 

His wife has had walking difficulty after radiation therapy for her gynecologic malignancy. She sees Dr. YAEL Pratt.



Social History:

He retired. A new management gave him 3 hours to decide whether to retire or to work nights.



Review of Systems: above



Physical Exam:	

Looks well.

BP:   126/60		P:   72, regular	

Wt:   148.5 without shoes, down 17 since May !

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	Trace edema.         DP absent R, 1+ L.   PT absent.   There is an area at medial tip of L great toe with ? underlying dark blood and overlying callus that is of concern.



Impressions and Plan:	

Would check some BS before supper as well.

I have several concerns:

Could his exercise-induced fatigue be an angina-equivalent? Will defer to Dr. Brian with respect to the need for another ETT.

His weight loss continues, without explanation. Dr. Chandler is aware of this.

His L great toe is of concern. Dr. Aldridge has been following this area and he will continue to follow-up with him.

A1c, CBC, Fe, TIBC, ferritin, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, Bili T/D, TSH, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, spot urine for microalbumin and creatinine



Appointments:	4 months

September 28, 2124



Interim History:	

Comes to review diabetes and related problems.

He had L THR in April

Has gained some weight since the surgery.

However, he reports that his BS are erratic despite a good diet and good appetite. He has had some symptoms of hypoglycemia in the late morning. He has checked his BS at that time and has found BS in the 70's-90's. 

Home Blood Tests:  

B 	87-140's, and occasionally in the 200's, which he attributes to    bad food    the previous evening. 

Retinopathy:	He has seen Dr. Dailey within a month or so. Again going next week. He has had a Bell's palsy by report. It has improved very significant ly. 

Nephropathy:	Due for microalbumin/creatinine ratio; normal in past.

Neuropathy:	No foot discomfort.

Cardiac:	No chest pain. No unusual dyspnea on exertion though he does have stable dyspnea on exertion doing activities in the house. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: He is on more insulin than he was prior to his hip surgery.



Social History: 

He is planning to return to work as a printing press operator. He thinks that he can handle it and gets to sit down a lot.

His wife has been having problems with what he thinks to be complications of radiation therapy for gynecologic cancer.



Review of Systems: above



Physical Exam:	

He walks with a cane. Looks pretty frail but his mind is alert.

BP:   140/64		P:   68, regular	

Wt:   164 without shoes, up 15 since March

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Neck:	No JVD

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Heart:	Normal S1; ? paradoxical S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	Trace ankle edema.        DP trace R, 1+ L. PT absent R, 1+ L.    There is a heel ulcer of L but the crust appears to be separating leaving healthy skin underneath.

Neurological:	AJ absent. Vibration sense moderately-severely reduced at the great toes. 



Impressions and Plan:	

Test BS QID a couple of days per week rather than every morning.

Reduce the NPH to 15 U and try to keep diet pretty uniform.

Call Ann Vandenberg if having any symptoms of hypoglycemia or BS<90.

Bring the heel ulcer to Dr. Chandler's attention when he sees him next week.

Be sure that he gets a flu shot.

RE:  Bruce Corona

FHC Unit #:  795-76-17



Dear Dunham:



I had the pleasure of seeing  Bruce Corona in the Cardiology Department office for a f/u visit.  Since I last saw him, he continues to complain of dyspnea.  An ETT was negative for ischemia.  PFTs were not really useful.  CT of the chest showed scarring/fibrosis.  His NT-proBNP has been on the marginal side, though he is without evidence for overt CHF.



Medications:  Aspirin 325 mg qd, Flomax 0.4 mg qd, Lopressor 25 mg bid, Lipitor 10 mg qd, Lisinopril 20 mg qd, Colace 100 mg tid.



Physical examination:  Reveals him to be well appearing. His BP is 120/70 and his heart rate is 60 and regular. He is 170 pounds.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His lungs are clear throughout, and notably demonstrate only very slight dullness at the left base.  His sternotomy is healing well and is stable.  His apical impulse is non-displaced with a slightly irregular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2.  He has an S3 gallop.  No murmur.  His abdomen is benign without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, or a dilated aorta.  There is no pedal edema and posterior tibial pulses are 2+ bilaterally.



EKG:  NSR with a 1st degree AV block.  He has a LBBB, which is chronic.



Impression:



1.CAD, s/p MI: currently stable.



2. Hypertension: under good control.



3.Hypercholesterolemia: controlled



4. Dyspnea: I suspect he has an element of diastolic dysfunction.  I will restart low-dose lasix.



Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in his care.



With best regards,



Bruce D. Brian, Jr., M.D.

	Interval History:

   His customary dyspnea persists, but otherwise, nothing is new.  No chest discomfort.  No PND or orthopnea.



Medications:  Aspirin 325 mg qd, Lipitor 10 mg qd, Diovan 160 mg qd



Physical examination:  Reveals him to be well appearing. His BP is 111/50 and his heart rate is 68 and regular. He is 176 pounds.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His lungs are clear throughout, and notably demonstrate only very slight dullness at the left base.  His sternotomy is healing well and is stable.  His apical impulse is non-displaced with a slightly irregular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2.  He has an S3 gallop.  No murmur.  His abdomen is benign without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, or a dilated aorta.  There is no pedal edema and posterior tibial pulses are 2+ bilaterally.



EKG:  NSR with a 1st degree AV block.  He has a narrow QRS with an old ASMI. Compared, the LBBB is no longer evident.



Impression:



1.CAD, s/p MI: currently stable.  Symptoms of dyspnea may be an ischemic equivalent, though, so I will give him a nitropatch.



2. Hypertension: under good control.



3.Hypercholesterolemia: controlled



4. Dyspnea: I suspect he has an element of diastolic dysfunction together with age-related deconditioning and chronic lung disease.  Nitrates might help the former issue.
